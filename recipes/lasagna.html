  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Lasagna is a layered pasta dish typically made with wide, flat pasta sheets. To prepare, a meat or vegetable ragu (sauce) is made by simmering ground beef or vegetables with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs. Separately, a béchamel sauce (white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk) is prepared. In a baking dish, layers of pasta, ragu, béchamel, and cheese (usually mozzarella and Parmesan) are alternated. The dish is baked in the oven until the top is golden and bubbly. Lasagna is known for its rich, hearty flavor and creamy texture.</p>
