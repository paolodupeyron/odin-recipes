  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Ice cream is a sweet frozen dessert made by mixing cream, milk, sugar, and flavorings (like vanilla or chocolate). This mixture is then churned in an ice cream maker to incorporate air and prevent ice crystals from forming, creating a smooth, creamy texture. Once the mixture is properly churned, itâ€™s frozen until solid. Ice cream can be flavored with a variety of ingredients like fruits, chocolate, or nuts, and is a classic treat served in cones, bowls, or alongside desserts.</p>
